Hi, this is my pet which I choose as my org's name.

Of course, I usually use them to display as my avatars.

I will introduce myself simply next:

I am 24 years old, born in JiangSu. 

This is me. ![me](assets/me.jpg)

I will graduate from ChongQing University in 2022, and my major is software engineering. 

During the university, I spent most of my time on study and practice. 

And I have acquired basic knowledge of network, database, data structure, java language and so on.

Then before graduation, I started an internship in a company. 

Later, I worked in another company officially. 

During this period, I participated in some actual projects. 

Through these projects, I have a deeper understanding of spring framework, message queue, cache, sql and nosql database and so on.
